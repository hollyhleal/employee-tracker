# Employee Tracker

In this project, I created a command-line application that accepts user input to view and manage the departments, roles and employees in a company.

I completed the following:

1. When the user starts the application, they are presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
2. When the user chooses to view all departments, they are presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids.
3. When the user chooses to view all roles, then they are presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role.
4. When the user chooses to view all employees, then they are presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to.
5. When the user chooses to add a department, then they are prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database.
6. When the user chooses to add a role, then they are prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database.
7. When the user chooses to add an employee, then they are prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database.
8. When the user chooses to update an employee's role, then they are prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database.
